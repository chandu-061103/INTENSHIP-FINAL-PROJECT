## **DAX Calculations for KPIs**

Here are the likely DAX formulas used:

```DAX
-- Total Sales
Total_Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])

-- Total Profit
Total_Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

-- Total Cost
Total_Cost = SUM(Sales[Cost])

-- Sales by Segment
Sales_By_Segment = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Sales[Segment])

-- Sales by City
Sales_By_City = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Sales[City])

-- Sales by State
Sales_By_State = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Sales[State])

-- Sales by Ship Mode
Sales_By_ShipMode = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Sales[ShipMode])

-- Sales by Sub-Category
Sales_By_SubCategory = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Sales[SubCategory])

-- Sales by Day
Sales_By_Day = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Sales[Day])
```

If profitability needs to be calculated:

```DAX
Profit = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]) - SUM(Sales[Cost])
``
‚úÖ In summary:

* **Summer & Winter:** High and stable performance.
* **Rainy:** Low sales, profit, and geographic reach.
* **DAX:** Standard SUM and CALCULATE measures across dimensions like Segment, City, State, Ship Mode, Sub-Category, Day.
